Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I'm a CTO at [Schuberg Philis](https://github.com/schubergphilis) in The Netherlands.

I help teams to deliver quality software, fast. If you're interested in how we build mission-critical systems I'd love to chat. We're always [hiring great engineers](https://schubergphilis.com/careers) but I love talking to smart engineers in The Netherlands even if they don't want to work at our company ðŸ˜„
