Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I'm a technology officer at [Schuberg Philis](https://github.com/schubergphilis) in The Netherlands. I help all our teams to deliver quality software fast. If you're interested in how we build mission-critical systems I'd love to chat. We're always [hiring great engineers](https://schubergphilis.com/careers) but I love talking to smart engineers in The Netherlands even if they don't want to work at our company ðŸ˜„

I used to be very active in open source, especially at [Apache](https://www.apache.org/), but not recently. My current hobby projects are [Type Link Model](https://type.link.model.tools/) and [Career Model](https://career.model.tools/).
